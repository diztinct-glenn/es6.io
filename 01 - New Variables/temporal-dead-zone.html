  // If you try to log a var before it's declared you will get undefined b/c with var you can access them as they are defined, before they are defined. I.E. - You cannot access the actual value of them, but you can access the fact that the variable has been created before.

  // If you use const or let above, you'll get an error. Known as the Temporal Dead Zone
