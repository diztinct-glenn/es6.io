  // Above IIFE is no longer needed in ES6. Instead you can write it as below in curly braces.

  {
    const name = 'wes';
    console.log(name);
  }
  // Advantage of this is that it's scoped to this block b/c of curly braces. So on page load console would log wes, but if I tried to call the name in console myself it'd give me blank string.

  for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('The number is ' + i);
    },1000);
  }
  // This 1st log runs immediately and logs 1,2,3....10. The 2nd log runs after 1 second, after the loop runs through every iteration. Therefore var i is being overwritten every time. so it will only show 'The number is 10'.

  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('The number is ' + i);
    },1000);
  }
  // So we use let since it's block scope. Now the second log logs each individual "step"
