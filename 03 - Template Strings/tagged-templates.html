  // How hihglight is placed above is called tagging. What happens is the browser runs the highlight function we created and it's going to provide it with all the info about the string (all the pieces that the person typed as well as the variables that get passed in). Whatever we return from this function is what the sentence is actually going to be. So it's sort of like a step in between. Before the sentence gets put in, we have the ability to modify it in any given way.
