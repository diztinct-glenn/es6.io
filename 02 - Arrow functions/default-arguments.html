  // This ES6 way is better because you can set it when you define your function. If nothing is passed in for an argument, then the defaults you assigned take the place and the function will still work.

  const totalBill1 = calculateBill1(100);
  const totalBill2 = calculateBill2(100, undefined, 0.25);
  console.log(totalBill1);
  // This would give us NaN, because there's no values assigned/passed into the function for tax and tip.
  console.log(totalBill2);
  // This works even with the tax being passed in as undefined, because the default function arguments has tax assigned to 0.13.
