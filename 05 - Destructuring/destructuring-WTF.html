  // Object Destructuring with variable renaming & default values
  const { w: width = 400, h: height = 500 } = { w: 800 }
  // Above is making variables w and h but renaming them width and height and assigning default values to them.
  // { w : 800 } is the onject that is being destructured. So the acutal value that already exists for w, i.e. - width, is 800 and that's what will show when logging width.
  // This specific example isn't common so don't stress about it.
